# traffic_accidents
Using a data base of 100,000 accidents across multiple states, filters the accidents by state and then ranks and displays the 10 worst accidents for each state. Utilizes a max heap and a red-black tree to store the accidents for each state and the lookup time to acquire the 10 accidents for both methods is printed onto the screen. A primitive graphical user interface is implemented using the SFML library to display the United States. Clicking on the red square associated with a state will print the 10 worst accidents for that state and the lookup time for both the heap and red-black-tree implementation.
